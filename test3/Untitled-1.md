Your logs and decoded outputs show **the model is not generating any answer at all**—not even free text, and certainly not the required `<answer>...</answer>` format. Instead, it's just echoing the end of the prompt or outputting nothing.

Let's summarize the **key evidence** and then provide a **step-by-step diagnosis and fix**.

---

## 1. **Key Evidence**

- **Decoded outputs:**  
  For each prompt, the model outputs only the last part of the prompt, or nothing, or just a question mark.  
  Example:  
  ```
  prompt: 'How does 4 years measure up in terms of week?'
  decoded: 'in terms of week?'
  ```
- **No `<answer>...</answer>` in any output.**
- **Training data is correct** (as shown in your earlier sample).
- **Loss is low** (but this can be misleading if the model is just learning to copy the prompt or output padding).

---

## 2. **Diagnosis**

### **A. Prompt/Label Mismatch?**
- If you trained with a prompt like `"Can you change 2 hour to its equivalent in min?"` and answer like `"<answer>120.0</answer>"`, but at inference you use a different prompt format, the model will not know what to do.
- **But your logs show you are using just the question as prompt, which matches training.**

### **B. Label Masking Off-by-One?**
- If your label mask is off, the model may not be supervised on the answer tokens at all.
- **But your earlier sample showed correct masking.**

### **C. Tokenizer Special Tokens?**
- If your tokenizer is adding special tokens (like `<|im_end|>`, `<|endoftext|>`) in a way that confuses the model, it may not learn to generate the answer.
- **Your decoded input shows `<|im_end|>` after the answer, which is expected if that's your EOS token.**

### **D. Training Data Too Small?**
- Your train set is only 10 examples. This is very little for SFT, but the model should at least learn to output the format if the data is correct.

### **E. LoRA Adapter Not Actually Training?**
- If the LoRA adapter is not being updated, the model will just copy the base model's behavior (which is to output nothing for these prompts).
- **Check: Are any parameters being updated?**

### **F. Learning Rate Too High/Low?**
- If the learning rate is too high, the model may diverge. If too low, it may not learn at all.
- **Your learning rate (2e-4) is reasonable for LoRA.**

### **G. Trainer/Tokenization Bug?**
- If the Trainer is not using the correct labels, or if the labels are all -100, the model will not learn.

## 3. **Step-by-Step Fix Checklist**

### **Step 1: Print a Training Batch**

Before training, print a batch from your DataLoader:
```python
for batch in DataLoader(tokenized_dataset, batch_size=2):
    print("input_ids:", batch["input_ids"])
    print("labels:", batch["labels"])
    print("decoded input:", tokenizer.batch_decode(batch["input_ids"]))
    print("decoded labels:", [
        [tokenizer.decode([i]) if i != -100 else "<mask>" for i in label]
        for label in batch["labels"]
    ])
    break
```
**Check:**  
- Only the `<answer>...</answer>` part is supervised (not masked).
- The rest is -100.

### **Step 2: Print Trainable Parameters**

After adding the LoRA adapter, print all parameters with `requires_grad=True`:
```python
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.requires_grad:
        print(name, param.shape)
```
**Check:**  
- There are nonzero trainable parameters.

### **Step 3: Overfit on a Single Example**

Try training for 100 epochs on a single example.  
After training, generate for that prompt.  
**If the model cannot output `<answer>120.0</answer>`, something is wrong with your setup.**

### **Step 4: Print Model Output After Training**

After training, for a known prompt, print:
```python
output = llm.generate("Can you change 2 hour to its equivalent in min?")
print("Model output:", output)
```
**Check:**  
- Does it output `<answer>120.0</answer>` or something close?

### **Step 5: Check Tokenizer Special Tokens**

Print your tokenizer's special tokens:
```python
print(tokenizer.special_tokens_map)
print(tokenizer.eos_token, tokenizer.eos_token_id)
print(tokenizer.pad_token, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
```
**Check:**  
- Are `<|im_end|>` and `<|endoftext|>` being used as EOS or PAD?  
- Is the model being trained to output these tokens after the answer?

### **Step 6: Try Greedy Decoding**

In your `batched_generate`, set:
```python
do_sample = False
temperature = 0
```
**This will force the model to output the most likely sequence.**

## 4. **Common Mistakes and Fixes**

### **A. Model is not supervised on the answer tokens**
- **Fix:** Double-check your label masking.

### **B. Model is not being trained (LoRA not updating)**
- **Fix:** Ensure LoRA parameters are trainable and optimizer is updating them.

### **C. Model is not generating enough tokens**
- **Fix:** Increase `max_new_tokens` in `.generate()` to at least 20.

### **D. Model is not outputting the answer format**
- **Fix:** Overfit on a single example and see if it can output the format.

## 5. **Minimal Working Example**

Here is a minimal working setup for SFT with LoRA:

```python
# format_example
def format_example(prompt, answer):
    return {
        "question": prompt,
        "answer": f"<answer>{round(float(answer), 2)}</answer>"
    }

# tokenize
def tokenize(tokenizer, question, answer):
    full_text = f"{question} {answer}{tokenizer.eos_token}"
    tokenizer.padding_side = "right"
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
    full = tokenizer(full_text, padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=128)
    question_len = len(tokenizer(f"{question} ", add_special_tokens=False)["input_ids"])
    labels = [-100] * question_len + full["input_ids"][question_len:]
    for i in range(len(labels)):
        if full["attention_mask"][i] == 0:
            labels[i] = -100
    full["labels"] = labels
    return full

# format_prompt
def format_prompt(self, question):
    return question
```

## 6. **If All Else Fails**

- **Try training without LoRA** (just to see if the base model can overfit a single example).
- **Try a different base model** (maybe the checkpoint is broken).
- **Try a different tokenizer setting** (sometimes padding or truncation can break things).

---

## 7. **Summary**

- Your training data and label masking look correct.
- Your model is not generating any answer, which suggests either:
  - The LoRA adapter is not being trained.
  - The model is not being supervised on the answer tokens.
  - The model is not generating enough tokens.
  - The model is not being trained at all (optimizer bug, etc).

## 8. **Action Plan**

1. **Overfit on a single example.**
2. **Print model output after training.**
3. **Print trainable parameters.**
4. **Print a training batch.**
5. **Check tokenizer special tokens.**
6. **Try greedy decoding.**
